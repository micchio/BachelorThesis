\todo{
Describe here scientific papers similar to your experiment, both in terms of goal and methodology.  One paragraph for each paper (we expect about 5-8 papers to be discussed). Each paragraph contains: (i) a brief description of the related paper and (ii) a black-on-white description about how your work differs from the related paper. You may place this section immediately after the Background section, if necessary.
